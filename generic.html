									<h1>Hi, I'm Yen Nguyen<br /></h1>
									<br> I'm currently a sophomore at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona studying computer engineering.<br />
									I am eager to embark on a journey of learning and professional growth. This portfolio is a little showcase<br />
									of my commitment to continous learning and practical application.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cpp school.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am pursuing a degree in computer engineering, which does not prioritize coding and programming like computer science. 
									Most of the courses I have been taking at school are Electrical Computer Engineer classes such as circuit analysis, discrete structure, and digital logic design. I took one C++ class in my freshman year and another object-oriented programming class in my second year.
									 I didnâ€™t get much experience in coding at school; therefore, most of the practice and learning I have to do on my own time using outside sources. Although my coursework has exposed me to a diverse range of topics, including software development and computer networks, I could use those ideas in outside coding projects and start experimenting with more complex applications. 
								</p>
								<p>My goal is to get better at software and coding skills and later combine them with my electrical equipment to create something in my third and fourth years in college. 
									I want to be able to understand the basics of both worlds with hardware and software because my major is somewhat broad. It would be great if I could practice more on the software side and implement it in a project.
									 For example, by building a circuit for a transistor-based audio amplifier and calculating the parameters that involve capacitors and current flowing through that circuit, I could create a program that could analyze the circuit and obtain the values of the components quickly.
									 The project requires a deep understanding of the electrical circuit and a good knowledge of a coding language. 
								</p>
								<p>Despite my limited formal experience, I am a quick learner with a strong desire to contribute meaningfully to a tech-focused environment. 
									At the moment, I do not have specific areas of interest but I am excited to learn more about what is out there in the industry and importantly the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting. 
								</p>
								<p>I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your dynamic team and expanding my horizons in the tech industry. 
								</p>
								<p>Thank you for viewing my portfolio.</p>
								<p>Sincerely,<br/>
								Yen Nguyen</p>
